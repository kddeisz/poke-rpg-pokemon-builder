# PokeRPG Pokemon Builder

A small webapp for building Pokemon per the PokeRPG spec.

## Getting started

Ensure you have `node` and `yarn` installed. In the root of the directory run `yarn`. Linting can be run with `yarn lint`. A local server can be run with `yarn start` (which will run on port 8080).
